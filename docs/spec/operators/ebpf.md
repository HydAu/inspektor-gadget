The eBPF operator handles the [ebpf layer](../oci.md#the-ebpf-layer)
that contains an ELF file with the eBPF programs. This operator loads the
programs into the kernel and attaches them to the different hooks as specified
by the gadget developer.

## Instance Parameters

### `iface`

Network interface to attach networking programs to.

Fully qualified name: `operators.oci.ebpf.iface`

### `trace-pipe`

Print debug information generated by eBPF with `bpf_printk()` to the terminal.

Fully qualified name: `operators.oci.ebpf.trace-pipe`

### `map-fetch-interval`

Interval in which to iterate over "iter maps", i.e. hashmaps marked with
`GADGET_MAPITER()`

Fully qualified name: `operators.oci.ebpf.map-fetch-interval`

Default: `1000ms`

### `map-fetch-count`

Number fetch cycles (use 0 for unlimited) for "iter maps", i.e. hashmaps marked
with `GADGET_MAPITER()`.

Fully qualified name: `operators.oci.ebpf.map-fetch-count`

Default: `0`
